| **Goal**                               | **Steps to Achieve**                                                                                         | **Proposed Solutions**                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Display list of available stocks** | - Fetch stock data from the `/stocks` endpoint.                                                              | - Use `useEffect` in React to make a `GET` request to `/api/stocks`.<br>- Store the result in a state variable (e.g., `stocks` array).                              |
| **2. Allow user to select a stock**     | - Create a dropdown component with options based on the list of stocks fetched from the `/stocks` endpoint.  | - Use MUI's `Select` component or any other library's dropdown.<br>- Map through the `stocks` array to populate dropdown options.                                  |
| **3. Allow user to select a duration**  | - Allow the user to select a duration (e.g., 1Y, 5Y) for the selected stock.                                 | - Add another dropdown or buttons for selecting the duration.<br>- Update the state variable holding the stock and duration info.                                  |
| **4. Fetch stock data for the selected stock and duration** | - Call the `/stocks/:id` API with the selected stock ID and duration.                                         | - Use `useEffect` or a `handleSubmit` function that listens for changes in the stock or duration.<br>- Use `axios` or `fetch` to make a `POST` request to `/stocks/:id`.|
| **5. Dynamically update the graph**    | - Poll the API to retrieve data over time (simulate dynamic updates).                                         | - Implement polling logic on the frontend using `setInterval` or an equivalent approach to update the graph every few seconds.<br>- Store and update the graph data dynamically.|
| **6. Display the stock data as a graph** | - Use a charting library like `react-chartjs` to display the stock data.                                        | - Map the response from the `/stocks/:id` API into a format suitable for `react-chartjs`.<br>- Update the chart dynamically when new data is received.               |
| **7. Handle API errors gracefully**    | - Handle errors when the API call fails.                                                                      | - Display a message like "Stock not found" or "Data not available" when the API response is an error.<br>- Use `try-catch` or `.catch()` to catch errors in API calls.|
| **8. Make the frontend responsive**    | - Ensure the page is fully responsive for different screen sizes.                                            | - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or MUI's Grid system for responsive layouts.<br>- Use media queries to adjust for different screen widths.                      |
| **9. Optimize data polling**           | - Poll the backend for data over time (simulate data fetching in intervals).                                 | - Use caching (`cache` module in backend) to optimize how data is fetched.<br>- Reduce unnecessary requests by only making them when needed based on time elapsed. |
| **10. Manage global state effectively** | - Use a state management library like Redux Toolkit to manage state across components.                        | - Create slices in Redux for storing stocks, selected stock, and fetched stock data.<br>- Use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to interact with global state. |
| **11. Provide a user-friendly UI**     | - Create UI components like buttons, dropdowns, and graphs that look clean and professional.                | - Use MUI (Material UI) components for consistency and responsiveness.<br>- Design charts that are interactive and intuitive.                                     |
| **12. Implement a login feature (optional)** | - Add basic authentication using Firebase for login.                                                        | - Use Firebase Authentication for handling user login.<br>- Add basic 2FA if required.                                                                             |
